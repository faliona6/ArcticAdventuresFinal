Zacharias: 
*blearily wakes up*
Dangnabbit, is it raining again? Why are there puddles?
*water steadily rises*
'Tis just a puddle.
*dozes off*

*water continues rising*
*wakes up again*
Ach! No problem. Just a puddle. 
*tries to nap again*

*water begins to fill the tunnel*
*wakes up in a pool of water*
... Getting real rainy, huh?
...
... something's not quite right, is it?



Zacharias: Haha! We've made it!
*runs around excitedly in circles*
Petra: Zacharias, just put the stone into the machine already. The victory dance can come later - there's still crabs around!
Zacharias: ... ugh fine.
*begrudgingly places stone into the machine at the heart of Crap Corps' operations*
Petra: Also, where's Stan?
*machinery rumbles*
Zacharias: ... He's tap-dancing on the roof. I thought that was the plan!
Petra: I said that he was supposed to be a distraction... Not entertainment. There's a difference, yeesh.
Zacharias:
*scratches head* 
Uh whoops. He seems to like tap-dancing though.
*machinery rumbles with increasing volume*
Petra: ... Let's just hope that's not the sound of all this starting up.
Zacharias: I'll bet you anything that half the ruckus is Stan dancing up a storm.
Petra: ... That's not how tap-dancing sounds, bud.
*machines continue to rumble ominously*
*machines begin to crumple and break down*
I think Crab Corps is done for! Let's get going!
