Hey, you!
Me?
Yeah You!
I see that your home has just crumbled to pieces.
Need a shoulder to cry on? 
Um... I'm good. Thanks though. 
My... my family died because of the crabs! They killed my mother, father and baby sister!
But I know deep down in my heart that they just want to see me doing well.
So I'll hold my head up high and live on.
Wow. I wish I had the same optimism as you... My mom passed away when I was young because the crabs stole our
food supply.
Oh... I'm sorry to hear that. 
Yeah. The crabs destroyed my home, and the entire place is rubble now. 
I feel like my life is over.
Wait! Life has more to offer! We can work together!
Work together? To do what?
To defeat the crabs! Let's get revenge on those bastards! 
Crab Corps is the orgainization that has been destroying our lives and our families. 
We can take them down!
Can the two of us really do that..?
Yes! The two of us, together. It's possible. 
Alright, we can go as a team. Just you and me. 
I like it! I think we'll work well together as a team! If you know what I mean.
Okay let's go.
