Zacharias! Come here!
What do you want, mama?
I want to show you the outside world.
What's the outside world?
It's the magical yet dangerous world outside the cave.
There are creatures lurking everywhere. But it's okay because I'm here!
What's the cave?
We're in the cave.
Oh okay.
But there are some rules. You have the power to attack things.
You can attack them by jumping on their heads.
You can also jump using space and move using WASD or the arrow keys.
Let's go! I'll teach you how to survive in the wild.
Okay Mom!
Just so you know son, I love you so much. You make me so happy. Let's go!
