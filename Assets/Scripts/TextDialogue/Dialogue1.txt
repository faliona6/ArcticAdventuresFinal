Several Years Later...
Zacharias, I want you to know... that I love you.
Mom? Where's this coming from? 
Woah, are you okay? You don't look too well.
You know about the crabs, right? I told you about this when you were a child.
The crabs have been picking up their pace in their search for oil, causing our homes to melt right through our paws.
The heat... it's causing our food supply to diminish greatly.
Is this why you're feeling unwell?
Finding a meal for one is hard enough... and finding one for two is nearly impo..sib..le...
Wait, Mom, wake up! I'll do anything! Tell me what to do! I'll get food, anything! I can't... 
I can't live without you!
Zacharias... I stocked up some food in the storage. Use it... and survive...
Mom! No... no! Don't... I don't want the food... I want you...!
I'm sorry son... I don't want to leave you behind in this world.
But having the both of us survive in the world ruled by the crabs...
It's impossible. I want you to live. Live, Zacharias... liv..e...
Mom! Mom... please... Mom...
I'll always be... right here... with you...
MOM! Don't leave me!! MOM!!! MOM!!! Mom... mom... I... 
She's gone... S-she... Why did this happen so suddenly? 
Mom... I'll promise I'll survive... I promise... 
One day I'll get revenge on the crabs... I promise I'll avenge you...
