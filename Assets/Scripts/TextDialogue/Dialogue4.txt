Child... do you want to defeat the crabs?
What..? How did you know?
I have my ways.
(I actually just overheard him talking with that loser over there.)
So who are you? 
I am... Old Man Aldweiner. 
Oh.
I'll give you a little tip, kid. There's something that you must do in order to defeat the crabs.
See that mountain over there?
The really tall one?
Well, yeah. 
There's a stone up there called the Endothermiosiscoliflower.
Wow, that's long.
That's what she said.
...
Anyways, this stone is the key to turning off all of Crab Corps machinery. 
If you place the stone in the heart of the Crab Corps master machine, it'll (hopefully) ruin all their plans.
What'll that do?
That will make global warming stop because Crab Corps produces 90% of the CO2 in the air.
Does that cause the planet to warm? 
Yeah, ya dumb butt.
Okay, so how do I get to the stone?
Step 1: Find the Mountain
Step 2: Climb the thing
Simple.
Uh, okay. 
The Endothermiosiscoliflower is at the top. Have fun.
Wait! Before you go, I overheard you talking to that little dastard over there.
Did you know, if you press 2 you can switch to Stan.
In order to switch back, you can just press 1 again and you'll be you. Good luck.
T-thanks a lot.
Also, Stan has better muscles than you, so he can jump really high.
However, you are blessed with a gift because you're the only one that can hurt the crabs by jumping on them.
O-okay.
