Finally! We made it to the Crab Corps and we got the stone. 
Time to avenge my family!!!
You're too loud. 
Guys, be quiet. There are still crabs around... 
We can celebrate after we put the stone in the machine.
Wait, what will the stone do again?
...
It'll turn off all of Crab Corps machines. That means that no family in the Arctic has to suffer anymore.
The crabs will stop searching for oil in the Arctic, and we'll be saved!
Oh yeah. 
Let's go guys!! There's no time to lose! Zachy, put the thing in the thing!!
Don't call me that. 
Zacharias puts the stone in the machine. The machines continue to rumble ominously, and eventually begin to break.
We... we did it!
Yes!
Cool. 
Crab Corps is done for! We'll never have to deal with them again. 
But... I guess this is goodbye then. 
You guys!! I'll miss you guys so much. Like, we've had so many memories together!
Like climbing that mountain! And... Yeah that's it!
Stan... I'll miss you. 
Zacharias. I... I'll miss you too. I'll never forget your soft fur. 
Petra, you too. You saved our butts countless times. So thanks. 
No problem. You guys helped me destroy Crab Corps! That's pretty amazing. 
I agree!! We did something quite amazing, huh.
...
Well, I guess we'll part ways now huh. 
Good luck out there, guys. 
...
THE END! Thanks so much for playing this game. During the last week, our team put a lot of effort into making
this game in such a short period of time. This game was made to address the issues of global warming and invasive species.
