The fact that you're climbing this mountain means... you must be after the stone.
Who are you?
My name is Petra. I'm the Snow Petrel that patrols this mountain. 
I saw you and your reindeer friend over there climbing from miles away. Welcome to the half-way point.
I see. I'm Zacharias and that doofus over there is Stan.
How did you know... that we wanted to defeat the Crab Corps? 
That's the only thing the stone does. And that's the only thing on the mountain. 
Oh. 
So, do you have a plan for defeating the Crab Corps?
We'll think of it when we get there. 
You know, the Crab Corps took my family away. The hot weather practically murdered my parents.
Oh... I'm so sorry. That happened to my mom too.
I'm sorry to hear that. Both of our parents are gone now... That's quite sad.
You know... because we have this mutual loss in our hearts... maybe we can use each other to fill that part up...
Uh... I have Stan though.
But... I can offer more support than Stan! I'm going through the same thing you're going throu--
But I have Stan though...
...
...
Anyways, our goal is the same. I want to defeat the Crab Corps too in order to avenge my parents.
Since you can't take that stone without my permission in the first place, the only way I'll let you leave with it is if you take 
me with you.
I'm sorry but... Stan has already stolen my heart. There's nothing I have in me left.
Wait wai- I'm not talking about that anymore... Just take me with you. I can glide through the sky and help you reach places 
you've never been before.
Okay fine. I don't mind you joining our team.
Cool.
By the way, if you want help gliding to harder-to-reach platforms, press 3. I'll come to your aid!
